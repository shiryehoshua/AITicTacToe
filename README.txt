To run a regular (3x3) tic tac toe game:
  $ python main.py simple_input.txt

Follow the instructions to play.

Based on not very accurate testing, the above should initialize
in less than a second.

To run a slightly more complicated game:
  $ python main.py twelve_input.txt

Follow the instructions to play.

Based on more not very accurate testing, the above should initialize
in less than a minute (~50 s)

To test my algorithms for time run
  $ python -m cProfile test.py numNodes numWins sizeWin
